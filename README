Flickr::API
===========

An interface to the Flickr API, including OAuth authentication.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test [ MAKETEST_OAUTH_CFG=config_file, MAKETEST_FLICKR_CFG=other_config ]
   make install


A NOTE ON TESTING

Testing authentication requires, at minimum, your Flickr api_key
and api_secret; a file with some minimal configuration data in
Storable.pm format that the tests can read and write; the ability
to open a url on Flickr; and the ability to retrieve a redirect
from Flickr. Since there is some user interaction required, full
authentication testing has to be done manually with something
like:

make test MAKETEST_OAUTH_CFG=$HOME/oauth-testing.st [TEST_VERBOSE=1]

or

make test MAKETEST_FLICKR_CFG=$HOME/flickr-auth-testing.st [TEST_VERBOSE=1]

or even

make test MAKETEST_OAUTH_CFG=$HOME/oauth-testing.st \
 MAKETEST_FLICKR_CFG=$HOME/flickr-auth-testing.st [TEST_VERBOSE=1]


There are two scripts in the script directory that can be used to build
and verify a Storable.pm format configuration file:

script/flickr_make_stored_config.pl and 
script/flickr_dump_stored_config.pl

When using OAuth, the api_key and api_secret are called the consumer_key
and consumer_secret respectively. When using the deprecated Flickr
authentication, the api_key and api_secret are called key and secret
respectively.

It is possible to use authentication testing to produce a configuration
in storable format that can be imported into the Flickr::API for future use.


MORE ON AUTHENTICATION

When using the original Flickr authentication, there are two methods:
web-based and non-web-based. For web-based the developer defines a
callback URL, which is where the Flickr will redirect the session,
along with a frob.

For non-webbased, you need to make a call to flickr.auth.getFrob to
obtain the frob to exchange for a token. The tests only deal with
web-based authentication. In general, since Flickr deprecated their
original authentication in favor of OAuth, more effort is dedicated
to OAuth.

If you are using Flickr's authentication, and you receive an
"Oops! Flickr can't find a valid callback URL." page, then you
are calling an API that is not web-based.
